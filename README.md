## 🤖 Built With AI

This project was entirely built using **Kiro CLI** (powered by Claude, Anthropic) — from HTML/CSS/JS to AWS infrastructure, Lambda functions, CI/CD pipelines, and admin panel. Development is accelerated with MCP Server (custom tools), Steering Files (AI context), and Knowledge Bases (persistent memory).
